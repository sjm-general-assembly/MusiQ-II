MusiQ-II
========

This application is the third development project for the GA WDI course. This particular project is a new implementation (re-write) of project 1.

Project 1 was implemented in Ruby/Rails. This version was written using Meteor JS.

The application is an online jukebox, allowing multiple users to queue songs to a central player. The 'now playing' list displayed on the central player, is updated realtime, as requests come in.
